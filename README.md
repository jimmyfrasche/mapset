Package mapset implements set-like operations for maps. This generalizes the existing pattern of map\[K]bool using a ContainsFunc predicate in place of a bool.

These operations treat maps as sets defined by their keys that happen to have some associated values that are taken along for the ride. When multiple values need to be considered for the same key a MergeFunc defines what value that key takes.

The Set and Bool types package these operations into types that can be used by conversion from a map\[K]struct{} or map\[K]bool, respectively.
